# LargeAssignment2
This repository implements the code required for Large Assignment 2 within the CSC 335 course at the University of Arizona. More specifically, it implements a library collection, which allows users to search for books with certain characteristics, update pieces of information associated with the books in the library, and add new books to the collection.
