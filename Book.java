Authors: Micaila Marcelle (micailamarcelle) and Elise Bushra (ebushra)
Course: CSC 335
Purpose: This class implements the Book object, which will be used to model the
books within the library collection. Each Book object will have an associated title,
author, rating, and read status, and the class contains several static factory methods for
creating Comparator<Book> objects, which will be used to sort Book objects according
to differing characteristics.
