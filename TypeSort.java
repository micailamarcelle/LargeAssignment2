Authors: Micaila Marcelle (micailamarcelle) and Elise Bushra (ebushra)
Course: CSC 335
Purpose: This class is designed to simply define the TypeSort enumerated
type, which can take on one of two values: TITLE and AUTHOR. This
is used to reduce ambiguity when instructing the model on what type of sorting
it should use.
