/*
File: MyLibrary.java
Authors: Micaila Marcelle (micailamarcelle) and Elise Bushra (ebushra)
Course: CSC 335
Purpose: Implements the main() method for the library collection, so this is the
file that will be run in order to actually run the library collection program as
a whole. More specifically, this code will handle the user-facing front-end of the
code, using the previously-constructed classes to manage user interactions.
